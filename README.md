PyCity Schools Analysis

It would seem that schools who had a higher budget didn't have better test scores. But, schools who had more spending per student surpisingly did worse when compared to schools with smaller budgets.

The smaller and medium sized schools, when compared to largely populated schools, out-perfoemed them in math scores and passing.

In the grand scheme of things, charter schools did out-perform the public schools in pretty much everything. But, more research will need to happen to determine whether or not this is because of the smaller student body or just due to the schools capabilities.
